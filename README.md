# Memory-paging-simulator
This application simulates the functioning of various algorithms for page replacement in a computer's virtual memory. The supported algorithms are FIFO, LRU, Second Chance, LFU, and Optimal algorithm.
The user inputs the number of memory frames and the total number of memory references of pages participating in the simulation. After that, the user inputs the numerical labels of the pages participating in the simulation and selects one or more algorithms to be used for the simulation. After running the simulation, the results are displayed to the user, including the number of Page Faults, i.e., the efficiency of individual algorithms.
